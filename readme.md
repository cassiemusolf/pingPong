_This ping-pong web application is a simple game that takes a number from the user's input and uses that number to count up from 1. It then finds any numbers, in the list, that are divisible by 3 and replaces them with "ping", it does the same for numbers divisible by 5 and replaces those with "pong" and, again, with numbers divisible by 15 and replaces those with "ping-pong"._
